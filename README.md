## 👋 Hello

I’m Davide, a software engineer. I was born and raised in Itay 🇮🇹 but moved to Ireland 🇮🇪 in 2016. Currently, I reside in Dublin.

I currently work at Elastic, where I focus on developing Observability solutions. Before joining Elastic, I spent most of my career at Amazon and Amazon Web Services, mainly working in platform / infrastructure-related teams for RDS Aurora.
