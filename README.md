ðŸ‘‹ Hello, Iâ€™m Davide, a software engineer. I was born and raised in Itay but moved to Ireland in 2016. Currently, I reside in Dublin.

I am a Principal Software Engineer at Elastic, where I focus on developing Observability solutions. Before joining Elastic, I spent most of my career at Amazon and Amazon Web Services, mainly working in platform / infrastructure-related teams for RDS Aurora.
